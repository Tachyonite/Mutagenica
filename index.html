		<p>The world is no longer as you know&nbsp;it.</p>
		<p>Operation FANG was leaked to the public in 2029 by a now-deceased whistleblower. It contained detailed information on a government project to develop bioweapons that would mutate a target instead of outright killing them. With this knowledge (and the schematics for such weapons) now in the public domain, the threat of untold change sweeping the world was unavoidable. In the spring of 2033, with no prior warning, the Green Bombs fell. Clouds of dangerously mutagenic fog blanketed major cities, and the lingering residue soon contaminated the groundwater. It is unknown who dropped the bombs, all that remains is the fallout and the sounds of a global&nbsp;menagerie.</p>

		<p>Not happy with this outcome? Well, so were 99.9999% of humans. But they can't change their fate, nor can you. You're stuck this way, I'm afraid...you're just going to have to get used to your new life. And even if you do try to cheat fate, you know what you <i>truly</i>&nbsp;are.</p>
